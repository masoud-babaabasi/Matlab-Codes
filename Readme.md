# MATLAB Codes
These codes were written during my academic years. 
They mostly are the scripts written for project courses.
The scripts in the `wireless power transfer coil simulation` are the scripts that I wrote for my Master's degree project simulations and some of them are the scripts for drawing the measured data graphs.
`Transmision line simulation` folder contains the scripts for High Speed Serial Link course when I was the teaching assistant. These are some simulations for better understanding the propagations of a wave in a transmission line. 
## Pictures of Scripts' outputs
You can run the scripts and see the results for yourself. Some pictures of the plotted outputs are taken. Check out the pictures provided in the folders if you don't want to run the scripts.
## Transmission Line
Eye diagram plotted using a real measured S-parameter file. In this script a FIR filter is designed to equalize the transmission line step response.

## Wireless Power Transfer
In this picture a closed loop algorithm is running. It is simultaneously is adhusting the transmiters' power and their excitation pattern and gathering data of power on the receiver module and calculating the efficiency of the power transfer. and tries to maximize the power transfer efficiency.

In the picture shown below the magnetic field of 2 adjacent coils is simulated both for in-phase and anti-phase excitation.

## Biological Signal Proseccing
In the picture below, the stage results of some signal conditioning on a given ECG recording is done. After signal conditioning, a template Q and P wave of this signal is constructed.
